# Why I stop to maintain this repository

So I'm still learning Node but when I jump into the professional life, I
realize that it's not feasable to maintain learning Notes. So I learn things
On The Way according to What I need in working projects. So this is archived
repo.


# Node-Learning
Node-Learning Repo. contains all the learning topic and relevent small projects

# Offline Modules
`offline-module` folder contains all the important node modules that I require to learn node.js because I don't have enough electricity and data to continously supply my laptop. So I did this.

# Notes

- [Node](./Node/01-What-is-Node/README.md)

- [Express](./Express-Framework/README.md)
